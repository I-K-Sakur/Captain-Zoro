1) INITIAL DEVELOPMENT:
   [i] Concept and Plan:
   The first during the development the thing that was needed was the concept.And the concept was Cartle and Military related game.Which was the core concept of the Project.
   [ii] Writing Story:
   The next thing was writing story and script based on the concept.The characters and others.

    [iii]Bug Fixing and Testing:
    It depended on the complexity of environment and codes.Also Navmesh agent is also a part of it.
3) FUTURE UPDATE:
    In future there is a plan working with past story of Furizz.Like why and how he became a villain character and how he had built that big cartle army. 

#Why It Meets Complexity and Distinctiveness Requirement?
1) INNOVATIVE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS:
  ->Shooting at enemies and enemies also shoots at player try to clear.The player must have to be careful about the Player's heart level.Cause once it is finished the Mission must be restarted by clicking 'enter' and there are no other choices of refill the heart.
  ->There are animation related to story which made the Game more attractive while playing.
  ->There are vehicles (Trucks,Spaceship) which player can drive during game.

 2) Advanced AI Systems:  
 Used Navmesh so that the AI can walk,run in the game.
 Strong codes are used here so that the AI can interact with game scenarios and can take their own decision.
 In the last moment of mission "killing Furizz" and "The last Run" an AI players(Who is ASAD according to the story) keeps following the players to get to the spaceship.

3) Unique Art Style or Aesthetic: The environment art is Unique here.Audio,Animation that were used will attract and will give goosebumb to the player during the game.
